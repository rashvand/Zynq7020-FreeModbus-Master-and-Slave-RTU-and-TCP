* Zynq platform specific functions.
*
* 02/29/2012: UART initialization is removed. Timer initializations are
* removed. All unnecessary include files and hash defines are removed.
* 03/01/2013: Timer initialization is added back. Support for SI #692601 is
* added in the timer callback. The SI #692601 refers to the following issue.
*
* The EmacPs has a HW bug on the Rx path for heavy Rx traffic.
* Under heavy Rx traffic because of the HW bug there are times when the Rx path
* becomes unresponsive. The workaround for it is to check for the Rx path for
* traffic (by reading the stats registers regularly). If the stats register
* does not increment for sometime (proving no Rx traffic), the function resets
* the Rx data path.
